.. admonition:: Precautions

 - First, insert the screws through the underside of the basswood board numbered "A," then place the copper standoffs and tighten them. Next, place the ESP32 development board and tighten the screws to secure it.
 - The serial numbers on the basswood boards are used only to distinguish one board from another. In the tutorial examples, the serial numbers face outward for ease of illustration, but they should face inward during installation. This principle should also be followed for subsequent basswood installations.

.. admonition:: Precautions

 - When securing the battery compartment, use flat-head screws. If you use round-head screws, the screws will protrude and press against the battery, preventing it from being installed properly.

Step 3: Install the base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parts list: Basswood boards with "B, C, D, E, F"、 blue latch (6 PCS).

The installation is shown in the following figure:

.. admonition:: Precautions

 - The order in which basswood boards with "B, C, D, E" can be installed is not restricted, but basswood board "F" must be installed after them.
 - In this step, only the six bottom latches need to be installed. The latches connected to the basswood board "F" do not need to be installed yet.
