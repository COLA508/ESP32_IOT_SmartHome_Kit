The  Kit Course Learning
========================

 - This kit not only provides you with a complete course curriculum but also guides you through a step-by-step in-depth study of the fundamentals and applications of the Internet of Things. 
 - In this section, we'll individually introduce each component and functional module included in the kit, from basic sensors and actuators to communication modules, to help you systematically understand their functions and usage. 
 - By studying the working principles of these components, you'll not only master how to connect and control modules in real-world projects, but also gain a deeper understanding of how IoT systems achieve environmental perception, intelligent linkage, and remote operation. 
 - This will lay a solid foundation for your subsequent experiments, course design, and IoT project development, allowing you to better grasp the core knowledge of smart hardware and the Internet of Things.
