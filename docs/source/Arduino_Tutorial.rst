Arduino IDE Getting Started Tutorial
====================================

Introduction
------------

*The Arduino IDE is an open-source programming tool officially provided by Arduino, supporting C/C++ development. It provides users with simple and intuitive code writing, compiling, and uploading functions, making it easy to burn programs to development boards such as Arduino and ESP32. The IDE includes extensive built-in example code and supports library file extensions, allowing developers to quickly access drivers for various sensors and modules, enabling a rich set of hardware interaction features. With its cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, and Linux), the Arduino IDE is widely used in education, makerspaces, and IoT development, making it an essential tool for both beginners and advanced embedded development learners.*

Install Arduino IDE on Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Linux users, please follow the official tutorial for Arduino IDE 2.0 installation:  

`Linux Installation Guide <https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started/ide-v2-downloading-and-installing#linux>`_


Open the Arduino IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you open Arduino IDE for the first time:  

- The software will automatically install the **Arduino AVR Boards**, built-in libraries, and other required files.

Now your Arduino IDE is ready to use! ðŸŽ‰  

.. note::

   - If some installations fail due to network issues, simply **reopen the Arduino IDE** and it will continue the remaining installation steps.  
   - The **Output Window** will not appear automatically after setup. It will only open when you click **Verify** or **Upload**.
